|    Folder name         |    Description                            |
| :--------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|  ./nginx-cfg/*.conf    | Should contain all nginx configuration we want to include into image |
|  ./                    | Should contain nginx application source code                         |
|  ./bin/init_script     | Script that would be executed before launching nginx process. Can be used to replace values in configuration.|


Configuration
-------------
The nginx container image supports the following configuration variable, which can be set by using the `-e` option with the docker run command:


|    Variable name       |    Description                            |
| :--------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|  `NGINX_LOG_TO_VOLUME` | By default, nginx logs into standard output, so the logs are accessible by using the docker logs command. When `NGINX_LOG_TO_VOLUME` is set, nginx logs into `/var/log/nginx16`, which can be mounted to host system using the Docker volumes. |
